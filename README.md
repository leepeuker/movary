Movary is free and open source web application to track, rate and explore your movie watch history.
You can host it for yourself and others.
It offers detailed statistics, 
third-party integrations for importing and exporting your history from platforms like Trakt, Letterboxd, or Netflix,
automated play tracking for Plex, Jellyfin or Emby and much [more](#features).

**Disclaimer:** This project is still in an experimental (but usable) state.
There are plans to add more and improve existing features before creating the 1.0 Release,
which can lead to sudden breaking changes from time to time, so keep the release notes in mind when updating until then.

## Features
